# How Deep Will You Go
**The Crushing Dark** is a solo journaling game exploring the depths of scientific discovery and your sanity. As you take your (likely) one-way trip to the deepest parts of the ocean, you’ll record your observations and experiences as you encounter unknown sights, strange creatures, and realizate what waits for you above.
How dedicated do you remain to your quest for discovery? Play to find out.
**The Crushing Dark** is a **Wretched & Alone** game based on *The Wretched* by Chris Bissette. It is intended for one player and requires a standard deck of playing cards and a collection of stones.
