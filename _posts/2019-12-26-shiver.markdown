It has barely reached midwinter, and already starvation has come. There is no help coming from far off Fort Duhrin. Legends tell of the Everspring: a place in the forest of Kalduhr where trees are bountiful with fruit, game that lies down at your feet, and rivers of  sweet, golden honey.

You have volunteered to find it. Head into the forest and save the lives of your friends and fellow townspeople, or die trying.

### Content Warning.
This incursion contains potentially triggering content related to eating disorders, specifically the effects of malnutrition/starvation, and animal suffering due to natural causes (not from human abuse).
