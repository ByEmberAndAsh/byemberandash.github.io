##Explore a Strange New Region
After surviving a terrible winter, explorers from your village found that a previously closed mountain pass was now open. On their return, word quickly spread of the incredible and strange wonders they witnessed. Now, a stream of explorers, natural philosophers, and plunderers are gearing up to cross that same pass and explore ančwuntouched world.
The rumormongers missed several important pieces of information: only one member of the expedition returned; they were feverish and spoke incoherently about strange monsters; they quickly died, their body bruised and red, covered with welts and bites. As your expedition sets forth, will you suffer the same fate?
